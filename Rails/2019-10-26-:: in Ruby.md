#  :: in Ruby
 As we all know ,"::" is a normal signal in Ruby.
 And then what's it?
 :: is basically a namespace resolution operator.
 It allows you to access items in modules, or class-level items in classes. for example, say you had this setup:
 
 `module SomeModule
 		module InnerModule
 		class MyClass 
 			CONSTANT = 5
 			end
 			end
 	end
 ` 
 You could access CONSTANT From outside the module as SomeModule::InnerModule::MyClass::CONSTANT.
 It doesn't affect instance methods defined in a class, since you access those with a different syntax(the dot.)
 

	When you see ActiveRecord::Base in Rails it means that Rails has something like
	
	module ActiveRecord
	class Base
	end
	end

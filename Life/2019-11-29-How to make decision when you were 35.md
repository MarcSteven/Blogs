Yeah, it's not a great topic to talk. But I found there are lots of stories about the programmers. It's so common.

When you became older than before, it's tougher to find a way to live unless you are a boss.

That's true story.
** Why most companies refused these people **
Because there is a rule -Your incoming is growing via your experience, but less companies paid enough. And then as a boss
They desired fresh blood to do .
You owned a family, you cannot spend more time on your daily life.
Your body was on the decline,working overtime can make you went wrong.
But someone will say "You are so older , you should be a leader in the team, or you are a loser."
As we all know , the position of management is limited, someone is suitable for this cake, but someone focus on the technology.
If you always think like that, in someday you won't own the genius.
In China, it's not easy to live. -from my foreign friend learning in Beijing.
Because there are lots of human resources, so the companies owned more choices. 
For this case you only have one choice - to make you outstanding in the field of the industry you loved.

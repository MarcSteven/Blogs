It's half a year ,how time flies!I cannot forget the period in my lifetime, just because I will remember the important lesson.
What I learned in 2018:

* 1,Your accomplishment is up to your health
* 2,Don't trust the words easily what he/she said to me ,test it
* 3,Care about the relatives forever and then fight for your aims.
* 4, How to become a good technology leader
* 5, How to be a smart boss
* 6,When you got TB, what to do during the following life

For me ,it's not a successful career in 2018.But I don't want to cheat anyone to hide these cases.
# The first company failed
  One more years earlier I bought a ticket without any hesitations and then went to SZ, for me There are other choice -my previous boss wanted me to go to USA together with him and developed the block chain.I knew the technology of block chain was the hottest topic in 2018.But for me I just wanna do some useful projects ,so I refused his invitation .For me never regret this decision.

  So I chose to work together with one boss(I ever met in SZ one year earlier).He hired more developers to develop one social media software ,but the result went wrong .In a word he always cannot find the right one to deal with it.So he invited me to help him to improve the performance.So I promised at once,I never discussed with my families and friends.
Why I chose this company not a big company?Just because I focus on this product ,it looks like a bridge to connect with more people ,that's so cool I wanna do all the time.So why not do it better.

  The iOS team was small .It's three iOS developers if plus me.The experience was limited ,the software system used the standard MVC.For this I have my own view.If you put more complex logic into one class ,it cannot optimize well.As a developer we should keep one thing in mind - Refactor all the time.When the piece of code was duplicated three times, you should make it reusable .If you met issues ,finding a solution is cool to improve your skill.
  
  But the boss never told me what his enterprise did ,I just wanna construct the product well ,it's called medical circles.But his business was from the outsourcing software ,for me I never joined the company just because I love technology.But outsourcing software looks like quick meals ,you never care about its performance ,just one simple truth-make it run.For enterprise the incoming is momentous ,once your incoming broken ,how to pay the salary to your employee. But how outsourcing software made money, just one rule -make it run using the least amount of time.
  
  So finally I left this company (Because my boss cannot afford me wage).I met Frank there , so that's the beginning of the second story.I never believe I can meet so unfortunate case ,but eventually all occurs to me .Frank is 43 years old man, owns a car(less than 20W, didn't have a apartment in SZ).He was tricky ,he wanted to do a platform to serve in the industry of cross border.I never knew him ,but Andy knew him well.So Andy looked like a bridge to connect us together.Because all the employees both resigned because of wage.So Frank's plan was empty .He just offered 60000 RMB to the enterprise ,but give enterprise stock (5%).
# I met a tricky boos from Hunan
I met Frank three times and then discussed with Andy ,finally we both agreed to join as one employee .
I helped him to do these tasks:
1,Construct the team

I am the first employee and Andy was the second one ,we don't have designer ,we didn't have back-end developer.So hiring them is the main task.I hired a young designer (My friend recommended me one designer) and interviewed one Rails developer remotely.Less than one week ,the main staff was ready.
2,Turn the idea into the product

Frank had his idea ,but how to turn it into a product ,that's not easy.Because all the flow was based on his thought ,lack of the research in the market ,so it's not easy to test ,the idea was same as 雨果网https://www.cifnews.com.
I helped him to tidy up the idea flow .Turning it into documentation is necessary.
3,Master the process of development

He is not a good product manager ,so he cannot do this .Always changed his mind to change the style.So it made the employees fall down.For the successful enterprise ensuring one solution is so smart, and then made it done.
4,Write the architecture of mobile platform

I developed the architecture of mobile platform ,the technology stack is MVVM+C, made core business logic into a component and then add test case to confirm the logic.Made a common code style ,the programming language I chose is Swift plus Kotlin.
5,Reviewed the source code from back-end developers

Because the back-end developer worked remotely ,so the cost of communication was dear.He never followed the common code style to write the code and then never add enough comments.
The technology stack:Rails+Grape+Docker+Builder+SOA+Rspec/etc
Why I left?
Just because he promised more but did less. I am a developer ,I did my job well ,but you are a boss ,you never make it into a reality.He actually was not a boss ,he just wanted to cheat the money from VR, that's so common in China.Lack of responsibility and passion so starting a startup is only a lie.Till now he never paid me my wage.
I worked from AM8:00 - PM 10:00.He never offered me a vacation ,never care about my all.Just focus on his business.But half one year I had forgotten him completely.For this it was one lesson.
I chose to forget the painful experience just because in my life there are lots of valuable case ,I must move forward whatever I met ,never stop fighting for it.Keep positive and then I could get what I want ,perhaps the process was not easy.So what.
# The better job starts ,but I got disease.
  The final company is a big company (600 employees+).It produced intelligent bracelet.I am one SDK developer(iOS, mainly maintain the all the SDK Package).

  But less than one month I felt my body has a bit pain.So I left the company because I must check my body and then let it run well.
  
  Unfortunately I checked my body and then the doctor told me "You perhaps got TB."OMG, unbelievable ,but true .I was treated within half one year.
  Now,I am ok ,I prepare for any challenges to start my chapter .I wrote this blog to avoid your doubt ,I don't want to lie about the empty period .I just wanna keep faith and trust.
  I still love this proverb:
Where there is a will ,there is a way.
Why I chose to write the story ?Not because I wanna Get one's sympathy**.Just let you know my all.Life is unknown ,so for me prepare for all the challenges all the time ,never explain more about the unlucky cases.**
As a programmer I still have passion and creativity to start my new Chapter.
I ever played an important role in the team -Team leader .Helped enterprise to design the architecture and give new hand more guidance to let them grow fast.

  I have my own advantages to help you to extend your business .
  In life I was positive and happy ,I can face all the pressures from work.For me I like this role -problem solver ,not a programmer .If you feel I am ok ,pls leave messages here or send message ,don't be shy…Honor to know your existence .
So I am ready to continue my career.If you hired me ,I will try my best to make the product better. Your trust is my power to move forward.Thank for your reading.
  Everyone has their previous experience ,it's the road to be mature ,if the previous time was not good ,improve it and then you can do it better.Perhaps in your heart I am not the best one ,but I never pause to make me outstanding .

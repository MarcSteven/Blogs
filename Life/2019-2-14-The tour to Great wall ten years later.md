As we all know ,It's a miracle in China ,but we construct the architecture to prevent enemies from entering into the city.
It's ten more years since I visited the city just because my sister married to a man worked here.
At that time ,I didn't graduate from the college ,the train is still blue without condition air.It's summer holiday before the moment of graduation .**I cannot forget the moment ,cannot forget the warm care from my sister.**She contributed more for the families not only me but also my other sister.
> Sometimes we are so weak that we never know what will happen to us ,for my sister's marriage it's so unlucky to meet so worse a man.**As a man you must own a responsibility for your family and your relatives, or don't get married.** 

# Ten more years earlier - 15th July,2008
It's a small city owned only 23 thousands of people living there ,from the train station to the airport it's only ten or eight kilometers.It doesn't have the prosperous like a big city like NY,SZ,BJ,GZ.It has pure culture.
I like its silence ,I like its style ,I like its nature, when you put yourself into the environment ,you will know how small you are.
> The big enemies for us is ourselves ,sometimes we desired more ,but pay less ,at that point it's an unfair trade.So impossible to get happiness.

It's a short holiday I stayed only ten days.Because the camera went wrong ,so lost all the pictures about the memory.
For this case it's memorable ,but cannot recall it forever.
The place I ever visited at that moment it's Jiayuguan pass passes the cityï¼Œbut I didn't buy a ticket to enter into the architecture.I saw the calms  firstly.
# Ten more years - 5th Jan,2019
On the way to Jiayuguan ,I found there are lots of sceneries I ever met .

I took the pic in Lan Zhou.Behind the city there is a large mountain around it.It looks like a huge man waiting for my coming.
The car is running ,but I am running on the train.Which one is the faster one ?I truly don't know .
These are the pictures I took here .
# Scene 1:Great wall

*The view is so wide ,but I think the mountains is where you want to go, the distance is nearly 280 km, it's called Qi Lian Mountains.*

*The water is flowing ,it's so weird just because the temp is under 10 degree.*

*The trees ,the frozen lake ,the sunshine, less people ,before AM 11:00 there are less people.*

*I enjoyed the great wall hundreds of meters away. *

*The frozen lake covered the road.*
![IMG_5383](media/15501147659609/IMG_5383.jpg)
*What's it behind these trees?You cannot see more ,if you wanna enjoy more ,move forward again.*
![IMG_5384](media/15501147659609/IMG_5384.jpg)
*The blue sky ,the great wall ,so perfect.*

*The distance cannot stop you to enjoy the beauty from nature.*

Startup means all is new ,so letting it born is not easy ,based on the experiences worked at Startup I wrote this blog
> **Success means you are different ,you must bear more other people cannot bear including rumors and blame for your actions and choice**.


* 1,If you can meet the people' true desire and then you can make it turn into a great product ,you can win a big cake.That's pure business.You  offer the service but the customers buy your service and then pay for it...#startup
* 2, But the toughest part is that it needs time to think about and then do a deep research for it ....Don't always think alone.
* 3,And then owned  a great user experience ,made the service simple and quick within the min time.The customers hope they can reduce time to accomplish it ,it means they are making money ,so the customers prefer to pay for it ,that's the key of business model.
* 4,For the startup ,the people can determine how the enterprise will go.Find the suitable people  .Suitable CEO can lead the direction of enterprise ,don't extend the people quickly when get the Investor's investment.Don't depend on the outside money.
* 5,How to know whether CEO is suitable,Ask one question "Why he/ she did this case",if lack of passion ,just wanna make money within the shortest time, leave him without a word.In  China there are lots of CEO like that, so tough to construct world-level product.
* 6,Tips for hiring the suitable employees :Don't treat employees as a slaver ,give them warm welcome and great salary.As  the CEO you must learn to share your success and wealth with your employees.Or nobody can try their best to do it.Let them treat the job as career .
* 7,Building a great team is not easy ,so you must choose the suitable CTO.If you never own core technology ,easy to copy and paste fast.Choose the suitable technology stack based on the recent team.Design  suitable architecture ,it can make you  reduce cost.
* 8,The test team is necessary ,constructing automate test framework is so cool ,improve the productivity and then reduce the bugs.Don't do the task manually .As a developer you must write Unit test to reduce the bugs.For the team 6 people is enough for your startup.2 Ruby expert,1-2 front-end expert ,one mobile developer ,one designer (UI and UX).It can save the cost.
* 9,DevOps is also cool ,but at the start-point startup should reduce the cost ,so you should find suitable tester(can write script) do the task....
* 10,Marketing is a must choice ,so let more people know the product as soon as possible.Don't spend more money on ads(at the start-point of startup) via bus tv.You  can find the people （Eager to solve the problem）.
* 11,In a word who can use the product ,who can be the first customer?But based on the feedback from market you must adjust the product in time ,or the startup will be over in a short time.
This is the idea for successful startup ,only my view ,so if you agree ,you can follow.

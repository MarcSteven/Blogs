It’s a long time since updated the last blog here.

I promised :”I should write one blog per month”, but finally I sworn my promise absolutely.

There are lots of words in my heart, but now I decided to write the blog to celebrate for my body.

First of all , let me give you a short introduction about myself. If you always read my blogs, you will know who I am absolutely.

My name is Marc Zhao, I am from China, a programmer desiring to change the world, I was born in a small village.

The life is unknown and risky, the time is shorter than I think. Within long time I cannot understand why all the unfortunate cases occurred to me. But now I understand it absolutely, that’s only lessons made me stronger and more mature.
I barely lost all except my life. But the luckiest part is that I am still alive.Perhaps that’s the biggest gift the god offered.
When you didn’t meet something, you never know how to live. I won’t guess the true heart. I won’t waste my time on something or somebody never treated me as the momentous part .
I admitted I am not the smartest one, but I never pause my step to move forward.


At the most time I don’t want to mention the previous experiences occurred to me. I knew something made me happy, but on the contrary something made me lost myself. It makes sense, sometimes you keep kindness, but not everyone can be same as you.
It’s a big lesson occurred to me within my lifetime. But that’s my experience not yours. For this no excuses to blame anyone, or you will say “If I didn’t make this choice, maybe the result was good.” But for this who knows?
If I can go back to 2018, how will I make the decision? I can escape from the worse case. But what if there is nothing in the world, so why regret? Perhaps that’s the life, sometimes you are not ready to wait for something or someone, but it/she/he comes. So the result cannot get a good direction to make you happy. But it made you know how to face something alone.
The lifetime is too short, when in childhood, I desired to grow up, but today I desire to go back.What a paradox.

The luckiest part is that my body is restoring. Thank for the supports and tips from my relatives and true friends. I know you are the biggest wealthy in my lifetime.

Don’t waste the experiences when you are going through something. Try to learn something from it and then make you stronger.- That’s the biggest harvest in the big lesson.

Now I am available now. I am finding a new chance to challenge myself.If you know some good chances, please let me know. Appreciate your help and retweet. If the cakes are iOS/Rails/Django, please let me know.

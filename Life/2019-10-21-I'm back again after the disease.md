It’s a long time since updated the last blog here.

I promised :”I should write one blog per month”, but finally I sworn my promise absolutely.

There are lots of words in my heart, but now I decided to write the blog to celebrate for my body.

First of all , let me give you a short introduction about myself. If you always read my blogs, you will know who I am absolutely.

My name is Marc Zhao, I am from China, a programmer desiring to change the world, I was born in a small village.

The life is unknown and risky, the time is shorter than I think. Within long time I cannot understand why all the unfortunate cases occurred to me. But now I understand it absolutely, that’s only lessons made me stronger and more mature.
I barely lost all except my life. But the luckiest part is that I am still alive.Perhaps that’s the biggest gift the god offered.
When you didn’t meet something, you never know how to live. I won’t guess the true heart. I won’t waste my time on something or somebody never treated me as the momentous part .
I admitted I am not the smartest one, but I never pause my step to move forward.


At the most time I don’t want to mention the previous experiences occurred to me. I knew something made me happy, but on the contrary something made me lost myself. It makes sense, sometimes you keep kindness, but not everyone can be same as you.
It’s a big lesson occurred to me within my lifetime. But that’s my experience not yours. For this no excuses to blame anyone, or you will say “If I didn’t make this choice, maybe the result was good.” But for this who knows?
If I can go back to 2018, how will I make the decision? I can escape from the worse case. But what if there is nothing in the world, so why regret? Perhaps that’s the life, sometimes you are not ready to wait for something or someone, but it/she/he comes. So the result cannot get a good direction to make you happy. But it made you know how to face something alone.
The lifetime is too short, when in childhood, I desired to grow up, but today I desire to go back.What a paradox.

The luckiest part is that my body is restoring. Thank for the supports and tips from my relatives and true friends. I know you are the biggest wealthy in my lifetime.

Don’t waste the experiences when you are going through something. Try to learn something from it and then make you stronger.- That’s the biggest harvest in the big lesson.

Now I am available now. I am finding a new chance to challenge myself.If you know some good chances, please let me know. Appreciate your help and retweet. If the cakes are iOS/Rails/Django, please let me know.

I am skilled in the filed of mobile development and web development. I owned eight more years experiences in the field of software engineer.I ever applied the experiences into the mobile development to help workmates to improve the work flow(Applied Appuim tech into the automate test). I upgraded the software architecture to let team make the value largely -pause to do duplicated task per day. I ever worked as the lead of techlogoy to design the back-end software architecture(SOA) and guided the team of design to improve the design flow and user experiences.

In life there are lots of challenges, but I am sure I am ready to start a chapter to help company to level up their products. For the previous experience I had no choice to choose, but this time I have choice to do something.

Why wrote this blog here, there are two main reasons as below:

* 1, aviod the doubt from HR because my resume has a empty period within one year, so HR perhaps have more doubts about it
Is he experienced in the field of mobile development and software engineer?HR: But why his career has a empty peroid? I don't explain more about it all the time, so hope it can explain clearly about the case.
* 2, record the life about the big case in my life - It proves nothing cannot  be beaten if you are strong enough.

##My tech stack:

* iOS:Swift/Objective-C/CoreImage/CoreData/CoreAnimation/RxSwift/Alamofire/MVVM/Redux/C++/Audio/Video
* Web:Rails/Angular/Bootstrap/JavaScript/VueJS/RxJS
* Database:MySQL/Postgresql/NoSQL
* Web Server:Apache/Nginx
* API design
* Version control:Git/SVN
* CI:Travis/Jekins

Thank you for reading and hope to have the opportunity to sit down with you and chat.
Have a great day!
